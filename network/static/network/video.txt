[Introduction] [00:00 - 00:15] 
Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel! I'm Shamim Hossain, and today I'm excited to share the progress on my CS50 Web Project – a social network site. In this video, we'll go through the key features of the site, including new post creation, all posts display, user profiles, following functionality, pagination, and the ability to edit and like posts. Let's logged in!

 [All Posts Display] [01:01 - 01:45] 
After logged in we can see all posts from all users. Clicking on the "All Posts" link in the navigation bar also takes us to this page. Here posts are displayed in reverse chronological order, showing the username, post content, date and time of the post, and the number of likes.

[Profile Page] [01:46 - 02:30] 
Next, we have the user profile page. Clicking on a navbar username loads own profile, displaying the number of followers and following. The page showcases all posts by that this user. 
If we're viewing another user's profile, a "Follow" or "Unfollow" button will show. you can see clicking follow and unfollow button not load entire page and update the numbers.

[Following Page] [02:31 - 03:00] 
The "Following" link in the navigation bar takes you to a page displaying posts from users you follow. This page behaves similarly to the "All Posts" page but with a more limited set of posts. Remember, this page is only accessible to signed-in users.

[Pagination] [03:01 - 03:45] 
To enhance user experience, pagination is implemented. Only 10 posts are displayed per page, with "Next" and "Previous" buttons allowing navigation through older and newer posts.

[New Post Feature] [00:16 - 01:00] 
Let’s explore "New Post" feature. Users who are signed in can easily share their thoughts by typing into a text area and submitting the post. now, let’s post something...

[Edit Post] [03:46 - 04:30] 
Users can edit their posts by clicking the "Edit" button. The post content is showed with a bootstrap modal in a textarea, and using JavaScript, the content can be edited without reloading the entire page. 

[Like and Unlike] [04:31 - 05:00] 
Lastly, users can like or unlike by clicking a "Like" button. this is updates posts like count without a full page reload.

[Conclusion] [05:01 - 05:15]
